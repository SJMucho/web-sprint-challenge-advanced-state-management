# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?

It is another option other than Redux to prevent prop drilling.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Actions are objects containing info that the reducer (a function) then uses to determine a change in state. This is then stored in a single store which is an object tree that holds the component state.

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
